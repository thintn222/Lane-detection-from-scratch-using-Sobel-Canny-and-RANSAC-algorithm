# Lane-detection-from-scratch-using-Sobel-Canny-and-RANSAC-algorithm
Implementation of the Lane line detection using sobel, canny, and RANSAC algorithm

This repo contained my solution for the project from the lecture: Topics of Computer Vision which was taught by Professor. Heechul Jung
The overall goal is to detect the lane line from an image using Sobel, or Canny method. Then, drawing 4 line into that lane using RANSAC algorithm. All of these method have to be implemented from scratch.
This repo consisted of :
+ Notebook for the SOBEL + RANSAC algorithm
+ Python file for the CANNY + RANSAC algorithm
+ PDF file explain my solution
